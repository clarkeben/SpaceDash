### [](https://github.com/pushpinderpalsingh/SpaceDash#a-dashboard-for-space)A Dashboard for Space...üöÄüöÄüöÄ 

SpaceDash is an open-source app that provides information on all the present, past, and future **launches and vehicles of SpaceX**. The SpaceDash app also includes news and updates regarding all vehicles and missions.

The app is currently in the second stage of development and several new features are being scoped/built. These features include an AR view of various vehicles of SpaceX and event updates from even more Space Agencies!

The project uses test-drive agile development processes, where requirements are turned into test cases, and code is improved upon.
